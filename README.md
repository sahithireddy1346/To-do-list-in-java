#**To-do-list-in-java**
This Java program is a simple console-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage tasks. It uses an object-oriented approach with a Task class to represent individual tasks and a ToDoList class to handle operations like adding, viewing, completing, and deleting tasks. The tasks are stored in an ArrayList and persisted to a file (tasks.txt) using file I/O, so data is retained between sessions. The program presents a menu to the user for interaction and performs actions based on user input, making it a practical example of basic Java concepts like classes, collections, and file handling.
